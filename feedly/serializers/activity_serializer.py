    Serializer optimized for taking as little memory as possible to store an
    Activity

    It stores the entity_id as an id instead of a field in the extra context

    - actor_id
    - verb_id
    - object_id
    - target_id
    - entity_id (new)
    - extra_context (pickle)

    None values are stored as 0
